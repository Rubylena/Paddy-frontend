Paddy is a platform or a safe space for techies to relax, journal and meme. Our team in Paddy was made up of Effiong Grace (Product Management and Back-End Developer), Essien Ekaette (Back-End Developer) and Okoli Ekene (Front-End Developer) and we all worked together to build this project, we all worked on different aspects of this project which includes a project management, development of the back-end and also building the front-end. 

if you were wondering where the name “Paddy” was gotten from it was as a result of the implementation of a note pad which is used to document and represents a friendly space where one can document, so we integrate their that into our product’s name. 
Since the project was a documentation web-app, we integrated a back-end and a front-end through which users can interact with the product. We also ensured the front-end was responsive, had a clean and intuitive user interface.

Technology & Architecture
At Paddy, we incorporated several services to produce a complete product. We also use Netlify to host the front-end. We employed the use of Google API for user authentication and order rest API for displaying data entries. Continuous deployments to the main branch were enabled for the front end.
The development of the front-end was done with use of HTML, CSS and JavaScript with an additional framework React.js, while for the back-end we chose to use Python and Flask framework. The relational database management system we used was PostgreSQL for its object relational feature.
Some of the features implemented are; 
Google API user authentication.
Creating, editing and deleting entries.
Editable profile that allows users to change their name and bio
